# Smart Secure Access Automation (SSAAS)

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to implement a smart, secure access automation system. It is designed for controlling and monitoring access points with enhanced security features.

## Features

- ESP32-based hardware
- Secure authentication
- Real-time monitoring
- Automation of access control
- Easy integration with other systems

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Yash241104/smart_secure_access_automation.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in VS Code or your preferred IDE.**

3. **Build and flash the firmware to your ESP32 device.**

## Requirements

- ESP32 development board
- PlatformIO or Arduino IDE
- Required libraries (see `lib` or `platformio.ini`)

## Usage

1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer.
2. Build and upload the code.
3. Follow the instructions in the code comments to configure your access automation system.
